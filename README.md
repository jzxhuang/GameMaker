# GameMaker
Two games that I worked on for the DPCDSB GameMaker competition. Titled Jester's Rampage and Mansion Busters, both finished top 5 in the competition. These games got me interested in coding!

They were built on YoYo Games' GameMaker Studio software, which features a drag and drop GUI that made creating the games easy - they didn't require much coding, aside from a couple manual scripts that we wrote. However, these games were pretty much my intro to programming, so they hold a special place in my heart. 

While I don't have the development files anymore, I've saved the executable files so anyone can try out the games if they'd like.

## Jester's Rampage
A jester is always getting abused and mistreated by the evil queen, and he's had enough! He looks to extract his revenge, with no mercy for anyone who dares to stand in his way. Check out the trailer that I made for Jester's Rampage by clicking on the jester!

The game is a sidescroller with a mix of wandering enemies and tricky terrain. It's simple, but honestly tons of fun to play! The final fight with the queen can get a little crazy, as she has an arsenal of attacks with unexpected special effects.

## Mansion Busters
A young, aspiring ghosthunter armed with a nerf gun takes on a haunted house that even the most consummate professionals stay away from. Everything in the house starts coming alive, and difficult puzzles prevent the escape of the brave teen - will he be able to make it out?

I don't have a trailer for this one, but [check it out here!](http://assets.jzxhuang.com/games/Mansion%20Buster.exe)
